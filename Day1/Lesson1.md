# Lesson Day 1

For this lesson you will be introducing students to the different VR devices and let them test out games on each device. Devices that will be available are Google
Cardboard, OculusRift, and Gear VR. After demo time, will cover game theory, and reviewing Unity Editor basics + covering terms that the students will see often during the development process.


### Game Theory
  - Game Theory Slides https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Oomc74eVqh1ccG_tV8ZvfaVrl3UNqyLooLvxw7MgaBU/edit
  - VR Slides https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sihf7KeMktDhbIXGSIeN1sbbOnuucxq5cElAC3a80yg/edit#slide=id.p
  
### Unity Editor
  - Refer to https://github.com/junior-devleague/unity-3D-racing/blob/master/Day1/Lesson1.md for editor review.
  
### Unity Terms
  - **Rigid Body** Allows game objects to access the use of the built in physics engine. Any object that must be influenced by gravity, act under added forces via scripting, or interact with other objects MUST contain a Rigidbody.
  - **Vector3** - This structure is used to pass 3D positions and directions around.
  - **BoxCollider** - A box shaped perimeter that will allow other objects to interact with the object that has Box Collider component attached.
  - **Prefab** - an instance of an object that can be used multiple times.
 
 **Add terms as needed. Refer to https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html for unknown terms**
