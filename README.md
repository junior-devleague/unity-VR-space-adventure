This is a comphrensive walk through tutorial to build a 3D racing game with Unity. This project is intended for beginner/intermediate students that have not had any experience with Unity or C#. The goal of this game is to introduce students to the world of VR development through Unity. Through this tutorial, students will understand the total build cycle of a game, best coding practices, and cross platform builds for IOS and Android devices.

 - Unity 5.6.2f1 https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
 - Xcode Version 8.3.3 https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

  #### Unity 
   - Make sure to install IOS and Android platform.
  ##### Linking Android SDK & Java JDK with Unity
   - Navigate to unity **preferences => External tools => Android**. Click on browse to add file path to SDK & JDK. SDK will be located under User/library folder. If folder isn't visable, you need to right click in finder **show view options** and enable show library. JDK will be located in **Root/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/**. By default Unity doesn't have root access so you will have to ensure the correct path.
 
 #### Xcode
  - Navigate to **preferences => accounts** click + by apple Id. Enter apple id and password. Xcode will automatically assign you a personal development team. You will use this team to sign your game before publishing to device.
